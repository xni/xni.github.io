        <h1>Stealth Web Browser</h1>
        <p>A browser just for you.</p>
        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <p>Stealth Web Browser is a browser for an experts. It allows you to control every byte send and every JS api called. Any cookie stored and any local storage entry created. It is ultimately extendible. It can not be detected, so it allows no fingerprinting. It is developed with ultimate power and modern technoligies in mind. Save. Extendible. Free.</p>
        <p>Some of the features we are going to implement:
          <ul>
              <li>Based on servo engine</li>
              <li>No logs are collected</li>
              <li>Bookmarks API which allows you to use BitTorrent Sync, VCS or any other backend</li>
              <li>No restrictions on extension distribution</li>
              <li>Super safe mode - only in-memory opetations</li>
              <li>Overridig cache rules for better offline experience</li>
              <li>Low-memory mode</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I was expired by vim. It is so powerful and so extendible that I want to create the same for web browsers.</p>
