      <description>Citadel Securuties placed its high profile traders to the isolated hotel in Florida. I am not saying this post will be an absolute truth. It is just a reflection of my knowledge about finance, how I have connected the dots of facts known by me to a broader picture. Perhaps, some guys like Ray Dalio etc etc have a better clarity about all of these, but I will try.
