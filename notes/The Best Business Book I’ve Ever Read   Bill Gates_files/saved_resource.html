<p>I think he is not being lazy. He said he was looking for job. Circumstances could cause anybody to become a beggar or to rely on other people's benevolence for survival. Even the great America received a lot of assistance from other countries after the 9/11 attacks. Remember Jesus asked a Samaritan lady for water even though spiritually he had the water of life. We are all dependent on God Almighty (Allah) for our survival, He could cause your circumstances to change as even some billionaires committed suicide during the credit crunch. Eschew arrogance and know that humility is the key to greatness.</p>

<p>oooo, no you didn't,,,, Allah your God??? I thought it is the name of Satan because Muslim Jehadists who commit all those senseless rapes, murders and beheadings shout "Allah o Akbar" right after they are done with their heinous crime! They also say that they are fighting against infidels...... and now you are asking an infidel for assistance???!!!! Isn't that against your religion? That is why I told you to ask your Allah for help, not Bill. Stupid is when you taghiyah?  Don't you pray to him 5 times a day? Don't you talk to Allah during your prayer? Why hasn't he helped you? Why are you begging an infidel against Allah's wishes? Isn't there a filthy rich Saudi Sheikh you can go to? They have so much oil money and yet Muslims all over the world live in poverty and misery. They don't care that thousands of Somalian children are dying of hunger and famine every day, They don't care about people like you either. I am sorry JEHAD. I think with all the deceptive, manipulative and violent behaviors the world has seen from people like you, it is VERY hard to trust you and think about acts of charity.</p>

<p>It saddens me to know how Islam has been defamed and misunderstood across the world by most of the non-Muslims,  who have bare minimum knowledge about the religion. Islam in the first place has no concept of killing innocent people - the so called jihadis/talibans are defaming Islam in the name of killing people for pious reasons. Allah says, "If you kill an innocent, you kill the whole humanity". <br>True Muslims respect all religions yet believe in one Allah who is undoubtedly The Supreme and All Knowing. I would suggest you to first go get your facts straight about Allah and Islam and then put up a debate. And do go read about those barbarous killings of innocent Muslims in GAZA by Israel...I hope you would know what a heinous religion is like.</p>

<p>I  stand by Israel 100%<br>Anyone who has a shred of intelligence can see that regardless of what they say, Koran is a source of Satanic teachings. and 1400 years of murder and destruction can attest to that. Islam and Muslims had 1400 years to bring "peace" and "brotherhood" to the world but, what they brought was nothing but Evil and death because either that is not really what they intended from the beginning or, the teachings are so wrong that they don't work. So this ideology is a failed ideology and must be abandoned. Islam is a failure through and through and if some people still insisting on implementing some social order that results nothing but death and destruction, they are either evil or mentally ill. Israel has existed for over 4000 years. There was never a country called Palestine in the history of mankind. Palestinians are savages who are (behind the scene) being provoked by Evil Islamic leaders to revenge on Israelis because they are dumb enough not to realize that they are being played by them. The Palestine/Israel conflict is not about land or occupation. Their problem is the Israeli people themselves. Muslims are the sworn enemy of Jews because an Israeli woman killed your sick minded, child molester Muhammad. I stand by Israel 100% and don't you play victim for me.</p>

<p>MR: Perhaps, as you say, "True Muslims respect all religions". In that case there are many, many imams who are not "True Muslims"! For they have been filmed many, many times calling for the killing of all Jews, Christians and other non-Muslims. And, MR, since you raised the topic of "barbarous killings of innocent Muslims in GAZA" -- are you aware that HAMAS has been killing innocent Muslims in GAZA, and grabbing them off the street for use as human shields, and sending woman and children with explosive belts to kill Israeli civilians? Is this what you call "respect for all religions" and "peace"? Of course you can try to deny this. But I'm quite sure that you know better.</p>

<p>You have no respect for Islam and our god Allah. I will advice you to go read about islam and our god before bad mouthing. Like in any religion their are good and bad people. Likewise, your people are not perfect either. You should not generalise that a certain population is all the same, just because a group of people that called them selves muslims do bad crimes. It is not what the Qur'an has told the believers. Many of the things that are happening around the world in the muslim world and the West is all due to lack of proper education. When people are ill informed they say, do, commit horrendous acts. Learn about islam and it's teachings before concluding or judging a book by it's cover. Wont be surprise if you decide to become a muslim after learning about the peaceful religion yourself.</p>

<p>I am a Hindu, but I always uphold a Bible with utmost respect.  Just for one reason, Jesus said if someone slaps on your cheek, show them the other cheek.  When Buddha become an enlightened soul, he became so compassionate and his love had no limits.  But blood stained history of Islam, the many of wars were led by your Prophet himself, either killed people or forced them to convert.  On what basis one can claim it is a peaceful religion ?  Prophet doesn't have any characters of an enlightened soul.  After reading first few pages of Quran, it was very evident that there is no divine revelation but something cooked up by Prophet himself.  I am sorry, this may hurt you, but this is what I felt.  Jesus didn't protest when he was crucified, but Prophet crucified others, whom would you rate as a higher soul ?</p>

<p>Mr. Manjunath, look who's talking. People who build their own 'Bhagwans' and then pray to them believing they would make their fates - utmost stupidity isn't that!! All Prophets including Jesus 'Hazrat Eisaa' are Allah's Prophets and they teach peace and love. The wars you are talking about have been initiated by non-Muslims at that time which were retaliated by Muslims then.</p>

<p>Hmmm...I need freedom to think about who God is, whether there is really God ?  If there is God what are his characteristics ?  And also freedom to understand the purpose of the life.  I do read lot and try to develop my intellectual level and my own understanding.  I am born as a Human to do all this on my own.  I am not born to blindly listen to what someone said 1400 years back.  The universal truth is Compassion and Love can make every creature on the planet happy.  I see that compassion in Adi Sankara, Ramanuja, Buddha, Jesus.  These great souls lived life of an example, lived what they preached.  Whereas, Prophet waged war against all, killed, enslaved in the name of the God. And finally started preaching about peace...isn't he a fake man ?  The one who commits heinous crimes and preaching peace...if you are open minded try to explore as much as possible, that is the purpose of the life.  Otherwise, we could have born as animals which are pre-programmed to live &amp; die without developing intellectualism.</p>

<p>Manjunath, I would invite and like you to read about Islam; your perceptions are totally wrong. If you want to know the true purpose of life, the harmony in this world and the love in the universe then know ALLAH...I can bet on it you would be a changed person then. <br>Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) is the greatest man in humanity. The wars you are taking about, probably you have to knowledge about the background and basis of those...isn't it unfair that you say such low words about our beloved Prophet without even knowing what the history actually is? <br>I would never say anything bad about other religions be it Hinduism, Christianity or what else, because a true Muslim never hates humanity but tries to make people learn the true purpose of life, the true spirit of Islam and that too with love and politeness. <br>For you life ends when a person dies but for me life after death exists too and one day Allah Tallah, on the day of resurrection, will reward each person for his goods and bads.  <br>May Allah show you the right path and forgive you for your misconceptions.</p>

<p>Some more indoctrination examples with U.Sens.

The head of the clown is most wanted but the FBI web site of CIA did not list him as wanted; reason "We do not have evidence" we are still after him ! You believed it without a problem.</p><p>Then that clown head is announced dead and body thrown into the ocean, you again believed the story without asking a single question; normally when a wanted killer is caught or killed, the body / evidence is presented to the world. They did not have the evidence and just gave a story which you easily believed just because you are indoctrinated.</p><p> [Later Hillary Clinton publically admitted, guess what? "WE (U.S. Govt) created AlQaeda!"]</p><p>You are supposed to trust your Govt. blindly however, you Govt. does not trust you at all; that is why they listen into yous phone calls! But you cannot listen into<br>theirs;  If someone like Snowden or Assange did, they make life hell for them.</p><p>Would this help you to open up your eyes about the indoctrination you are subjected to?</p><p>Syed.

<p>That is not true.  You can have difference of opinion on majority of Muslim countires.  For example, Iran this third country with most number of Jewish people.<br>When it come to endocrination, it is happening in the U.S.A. as well.  Here the purpose is to endoctrinate Athiesm and that we came out of Monkeys; isn't it?, without any explaination of how are we so diverse if we came out of one monkey lieage?  Are you not endoctrinated with this philosophy.  <br>Another one is "The Govt. or President of U.S.A. is always right" or "U.S.A. is alwayr right" or "U.S.A. can police the World" or "U.S.A. can bomb any part of the World" or "Can hold U.N.O. hostage" or "Can put Flouride in driking water, which is used in RAT POISON" or "Can use the Tax Peyers' Money or waste it anywhere but to help the poor U.Sens., e.g., Health Care - Watch "Sicko" by Michael Moore" or "Cars and living standards, entitlements are granted" or "in accepting that if you miss on home payments, you can be kicked out of the house", or "It's okay for you to get stip searched at airports; just because of an underwear bomber" or "in believing that we are a great nation while Indians and Chinese are clearly doing well in Maths and Scienes" or "If someone speaks against the status quo in the U.S.A. is a nut case" or "You nuked Heroshema and Nagasaki and wiped two cities off the face of Earth; no problem, but other counties cannot have nukes" or "It is okay if your food is degarted by GMO / Monsento" or "if your farmlands are squising at an alarming rate and govt. is closing her eyes, then all is well"... or " this list can go on and on and on....<br>When you point one figure at someone, you point more fingures at yourself at the same time!<br>Sincerely, <br>Syed.</p>

<p>Dear,<br>The truth, just PLS look around, you will be realize the empower societies in the world are creating and using radicalism in all religions in many places that have neutral resources, lack of educator and high poverty (Afganestan, Neger,..). I believe that is a best gadget for them to destroy the cultures and religions of those areas. However, for achieving the GOALS (more money, power, oil,gold ...) they need these crews.</p>

<p>You too should read and learn about other people's religion and God.   You too will be surprised at how our own myopia is being manifested everywhere.   Allah is great, so is other people's God.   The Bible and Quran wrote otherwise, so are other book of worships.</p>

<p>Ahmad<br>Your religion is not for those who are already enlightened people. All non muslims are among them. You should read other religions and highly likey you will leave your religion. It is lack of proper education you are sticking to what SIMA or Manjunath says.<br>Islam is not a religion of peace, why you convince yourself to plain falsehood.</p>

<p>Vimal, I feel bad about your short lived believes...have you known about the concept of divinity you would definitely know what Allah is. I am a proud Muslim who's modern, educated, travels the world and knows that peace is what Islam means. I don't care what is depicted by media or what the barbarous Jihads/Taliban claim...Islam and Allah are the peace of my mind, the faith that keep me going. I would wish to ask you about your beliefs when you die - You would definitely know then who Allah is.</p>

<p>Ayesha - i am an ex muslim who left the faith many years ago because i was disgusted with the concept. i was never able to receive the Grace that your 'allah' has given you. the biggest issue i had was why did 'allah' choose to reveal the quran to a man who was fondling a 6 year old. you call him a perfect human being - would you have called a man who fondled you at 6 a prophet. i would not and that is why i am an ex muslim and very happy that i got rid of this baggage.</p>

Like western Christian governments' agenda coo hoot with Zionist Jews sent to die for Israel &amp; Oil in other words for dirt or ground or parcel of land called country by waving a piece of cloth, called flag? Sent wrapped up piece of cloth Flag &amp; get nothing later when you are dead) Even than you do not know if your fighting an enemy or your enemy is your government who is taking you for a ride for their evil &amp; worldly agenda?

<p>Jafri, your statement about the 6-year old does not hold merit.  If you did not want to be a Muslim you can have your choice.  But plesae do not associate lies with the Greatest Person known to Mankind.  You are not more competent that George Bernard Shaw who accepted that Islam is the best religion; so your opinion does not matter anyways.<br>I am a Muslim by choice and I love it.  Islam is the fasted growing religion in the West for some reason.  Those who contemplate with unbiased approach eventually see the light unlike yourself.  Islam gave the light to the humanity who discovered and put together the pirnciples of science and methamtics, wihtout which you would not be able to move today.  Islam pull Europoe out of its Dark ages.  Please investigate why and how Maldieves, and isolated island nation, became Muslim?<br>Gandhi, after getting independece told his nation to follow the First and Second Deputies of Muhammad peace be upon him for a reason.  There was a reason Islam spread so fast and far in just 1400 years as compared to 2000 years for Christianity and way more than that for Judiasm.<br>Please be carefule about my Holy Prophet Muhammad Sal Allaho Aliyhe Wasallim as it is a great offence.<br>I really have a problem accepting a monkey as my great great grand daddy.</p><p>Syed N. Hashmi</p>

<p>very dear valued Muslims, including my own self. we should put ourselves in non believers place first than we should try to show them what is true Islam actually. by countering their anger, we can never conclude or convey the real message of Islam which is peace for humanity &amp; only peace. this is not their mistake, that they misunderstood Islam, it is responsibility of ours to convey them the real message of Islam, which is of our prophets actions &amp; deeds. Our beloved prophet always respected humanity &amp; teaches us to spread peace &amp; love, not hatred or anger. His acts shows the love to humanity, brotherhood, justice, right of women, right of children &amp; this is the main topic of islam &amp; Quran. Let us practice first, believe me others will die to follow. People of that time were impressed only by the deed of prophet.</p>

<p>Guddu, Please don't get me wrong but are you really sober? or you are simply acting like a brainwashed zombi? Because, I am so tired of you Muslims pretending to know of a better version of "true Islam" that is not being practiced by Muslims. Islam is what Islam does. There is no other better version of Islam. and Yes, Islam orders Muslims to Kill other people in the name of Allah so they can go and sleep with their 72 virgins for ever! Also, your atom bomb story is a very lame and illogical example. Because it is not only the leaders of the Islamic world that are ordering massacre of innocent people around the world, it is the Muslims themselves who have been doing it for the past 1400 years! If Islam really wanted to spread peace, justice, love, and brotherhood among the people of the world, it had 1400 years to do so. It is time to admit that this ideology and it's teachings have failed. It just doesn't work. When are you going to learn that there are better ways to solve the world's problem? and set Islamic ways aside and step into the 21st century? ISLAM DOES NOT WORK!</p>

<p>Ahmad: It is very hard for humane people to respect Islam when so many of its powerful followers spew hatred and perform violent acts -- killing Jews, Christians and others most everywhere around the world. It is very hard to respect a religion whose leaders do not respect the laws of the countries which have welcomed them and continue to subsidize them. It is very hard to respect a religion whose leaders rarely send messages of peace, loving or reconciliation about anything at all. It is very hard to respect a religion whose followers even kill followers of other branches of Islam: Sunni, Shi'ite, Bathist ...<br>Bottom line: Show others (and even yourselves) respect, and you just may earn the respect of others. Of course that's very unlikely to happen, because you live in mortal fear of your own leaders.</p>

<p>There are good and bad people in every religion however, the only religion in which the bad feels just and righteous for murdering other people, including their own children is Islam. And the only religion that shamelessly glorifies and rewards it's followers for beheading others and committing murder and genocide is Islam. Islam is not a religion. It is an anti-human, anti-woman death cult that has been in existence for over 1400 years because of ignorance and superstition of people like you. and Quran is it's instruction manual. Those who blame America or Europe or Israel for invading Muslim counties and taking away their human rights must realize that America came to existence a little over 2 hundred years ago and Israel has existed only for the last 60 years. but Muslims have bee poisoning the world for 1400 years, always fighting, always killing, always destroying and hating others and each other. Why don't you ask why is it that those rich Arab nations aren't helping many thousands of Somalian children who are dying of hunger everyday? Why is it that all the impoverished, under developed countries are Muslim even though their Allah has gifted them a head start by at least 1200 years as well as oil and other natural riches? Do you know why? I tell you why. because of Islam's hateful and uncivilized teachings. because of sick social rules that call for enslaving women and wiping them off the society and treating them like cattle. because, based on the teaching of this evil cult, one half of the society becomes paralyzed prisoners and the other half waste their life and energy, guarding their prisons. and all along, they have been drilled with a "greater goal of JIHAD" and are programmed to kill or be killed on their quest for turning the rest of the world into savage, violent, and heartless animals like themselves. Don't you dare blame America or Israel for the vicious cycle in these savage Muslim societies. They have been at it for thousands of years! I don't buy this game of playing victim. Muslim Clerics were the first authorities who became Hitlers supporters when he started his killing Machine. Stop being ignorant and start taking responsibility for your closed eyes and mind. Maybe then, we can have some hope for peace on earth.</p>

<p>Sima ! I read what you are saying, Islam is religion of peace, security and religion of justice, we have never heard my Islam to kill a human either Muslim or Non-Muslim Islam says if you kill one innocent person it means you kill all the humanity and if you see some groups named them Muslim and beheading people and oppressing on people it is just a drama and a policy by the enemies of Islam, in fact they want to show Islam in a bad image to the public.</p>
